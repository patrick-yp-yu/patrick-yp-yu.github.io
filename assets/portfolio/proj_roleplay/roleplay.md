# Introduction

ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI. The model is trained on Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architecture, and is designed to be a chatbot that can perform  human-like question answering. Users interact with ChatGPT using prompts, and ChatGPT responds contextually relevant and coherent texts to users.

In the gaming realm, non-playable characters (NPCs) traditionally rely on pre-scripted dialogues. The integration of ChatGPT revolutionizes this by allowing NPCs to dynamically respond to player queries. The project also explores the potential for ChatGPT to simultaneously simulate multiple roles for NPCs.

Within this Unity-based role-playing game, a player engages with various NPCs. The player poses questions and receives responses that are dynamically generated by ChatGPT rather than pre-scripted. The game connects to OpenAI through a REST API architecture, and retrieves generated texts in real time. The demo showcases ChatGPT's capacity to simulate multiple NPCs concurrently in a game.
